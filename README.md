## The Problem

### The Bigger Picture

About 11% of all the greenhouse gas emissions that come from the food system could be reduced if we stop wasting food. In the US alone, the production of lost or wasted food generates the equivalent of 37 million cars’ worth of greenhouse gas emissions.

In the United States, food waste is estimated at between 30–40 percent of the food supply.

### On the Individual Scale

* People think they will eat everything they buy, but they cannot
* People have little time in the day to cook fresh meals
* People are busy with work, children, etc.
* People often forget about what they have in the fridge
* Fridges and pantries can disorganized
* Food storage is often times first-in-last-out, and there is little space

## Our Solution
